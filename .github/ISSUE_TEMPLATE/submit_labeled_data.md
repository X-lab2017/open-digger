<!-- Please help us help you by filling out the following sections as thoroughly as you can. If you have additional information, you can adjust the issue structure yourself -->

I want to add some labeled data into OpenDigger to help us for our community analysis.

<!-- What do you want to label the following data, like 'Apache Software Foundation', 'Linux Foundation', 'Chinese', 'Microsoft'... -->
Label: 

<!-- For example, 'microsoft/vscode'. If you fill them in, it means that you think the data has the label you filled above. 
Make sure every data line starts with '- ' like:

Repos:
- microsoft/vscode
- kubernetes/kubernetes

-->
Repos:

<!-- You can fill in the name of the organization or individual user. 

Make sure every data line starts with '- ' like:

Orgs/Users:
