By collecting relevant data on github, we have obtained information about the world's most active robot account on github. In addition, we analyze the robot accounts themselves, including the developer information of the robot accounts, and the domain information to which the robot accounts belong (These accounts are mainly classified based on our own expert experience). In addition, in order to make the warehouses of organizations or individuals on github more convenient to use, we have also summarized the functional information of these robot accounts. Other users or organizations on github can also have a more comprehensive view of these robot tools through the links in the table.
